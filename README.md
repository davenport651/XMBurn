# XMBurn
A shell script that executes xmrig miner with some pre-set configurations while obfuscating the output. Currently configured for Nicehash. Useful as a stability testing tool (although there are no failsafes).

- Download and unpack the xmrig binary for linux: https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases
- Move cpuburn.sh to the folder that contains the xmrig binary.
- Change the pool url or username variables in cpuburn.sh to whatever suits you or use it as is.
- from the terminal, execute cpuburn.sh
