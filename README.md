# XMBurn
A bash shell script that executes xmrig miner with some pre-set configurations while simplifying the output. Useful as a stability testing tool (although there are no failsafes). Currently configured for Nicehash or a monero pool.

- git clone https://github.com/davenport651/XMBurn.git
- execute <b>./xmburn.sh nh</b> for nicehash or <b>./xmburn.sh prv</b> for private pool

- Change the pool url or username variables in the case statement to whatever you require or use it as is.
